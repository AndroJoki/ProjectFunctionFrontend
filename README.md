# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

This Solidity program is about an ATM system. The purpose of this program is to help integrate the Solidity program to the frontend and make use of MetaMask for the transactions.

## Description

This program is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to help developers understand how to connect a Solidity program to the frontend and utilize MetaMask for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as an example of an ATM system that allows users to withdraw or deposit Ethereum. The contract includes functions to handle these transactions securely and efficiently, showcasing how to integrate blockchain functionality with web applications. This project serves as a foundational example for developers looking to grasp the basics of connecting smart contracts with frontend technologies, providing a stepping stone for more advanced decentralized application (dApp) development.

## Getting Started

### Creating the program

To run this program, you would need to clone this GitHub repository to your computer. 

### Executing the program

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer:

1. Inside the project directory specifically in the terminal,  type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal, type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
6. After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
